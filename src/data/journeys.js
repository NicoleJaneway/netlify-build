      "Jon was first made aware of the CDMP exam when he began interviewing for an Enterprise Data Architect position. One of the \"nice to haves\" listed was a <a href='https://www.datastrategypros.com/resources/cdmp'>CDMP certification</a> as the organization maintains awareness of industry best practices and directional shifts in IT. This includes keeping up with publications from DAMA, Gartner, Forester, and others.<br /><br />After the interview process, Jon was hired by a sub-contractor for an evaluation period prior to being onboarded by the primary contractor. During that time, Jon earned the CDMP credential to boost his chances of getting brought on to the team. He got the job.<br /><br />Jon is confident the CDMP has made a significant impact on his career. \"Coming from a technical first background, it's easy to be too deep in the woods to see past the trees,\" Jon admits. \"The DAMA framework takes an enterprise view of the data landscape and describes best practices and insights that can help an organization improve its data maturity.\"<br /><br />Besides the knowledge gained through studying, Jon has found the CDMP to be very valuable for forming connections. Jon has quite a few certifications from organizations such as Microsoft, SAFe, and AWS. He thinks that the CDMP stands out, however, in terms of putting him touch with many knowledgeable and amazing people. Jon shares that \"I can't say I've had that same experience with any other exam.\" He's written a <a href='https://jonshaulis.com/index.php/2019/11/26/hurray-i-earned-my-cdmp/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>very helpful post</a> about his experience with the exam.",
